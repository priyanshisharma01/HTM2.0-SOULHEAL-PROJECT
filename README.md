# HTM2.0-SOULHEAL-PROJECT
THE TRACK/THEME OF OUR APP IS HEALTHCARE.  WE HAVE MADE AN ALL IN ONE HEALTHCARE APP (GUI) WHICH SERVES OUR BASIC NEEDS RELATED TO HEALTHCARE.
# PURPOSE/ ABOUT OF OUR APP
To start a good life healthcare is more important. Nowadays Health-care Environment has developed science and knowledge. Recently, we all have witnessed the covid pandemic that has put immense pressure on health systems all over the world and hospitals have been overwhelmed with patients, in such conditions it is very difficult to obtain the consultation with the doctor in case of any health issues. As more and more people start to use smartphones, they may provide a tool to help improve a patient's health and fitness. The proposed idea is to create a health care app system using python programming that can be used to know disease by the symptoms in a person and provide basic details about the disease before consulting a doctor. Healthcare mobile apps are becoming a reality for users. Patients are facing a problematic situation of unforeseen demise which is because of nonexistence of good medical maintenance to patients at the needed time. So we are proposing an innovative project to provide all the needed information on specific diseases from your home in case of problems. We know that there are already so many health chatbot floating around us but our app is over an idea of summarise all things together and provide a solution. It will provide you with details of the doctor concerned to your disease whom you can contact. As today covid-19 is concerned, our app provides all the needed information about the spread of corona virus, resources, data of the daily cases and necessary links of different websites at one place only. A remainder through notifications for the ease of the user, so that they can remember their medications even when they are at home or doing work and general home remedies of common diseases adds more functionality to our app and makes it one proper solution in this time of global pandemic where reaching our doctor is so difficult and maintaining a good health is necessity.
# TECHNOLOGIES WE HAVE USED
Following are the technologies that we have used in our project:
1.App Development
2.Python
3.(GUI) Application development
4.Web Scrapping
5.Web browsing
6.Jupyter notebook
7. Tkinter
In Python we have used the following modules to run  our healthcare app:
1. Tkinter-Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. It provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications and  provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.We used it in our app to create the whole Body structure of our app.
2.Covid- It is a Python package to get information regarding the novel corona virus provided by Johns Hopkins university and worldometers.info. We used it in our app to get the latest updated  COVID info.
3.Plyer-Plyer module is used to access the features of the hardware.  We used it to add notification feature in our app and to show the notifications on our device.
4.Time- Python time module provides many ways of representing time in code, such as objects, numbers, and strings. It also provides functionality other than representing time, like waiting during code execution and measuring the efficiency of your code.We used it in our app's notification feature.
5.Numpy-it is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays. It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
6.Pandas- It provides ready to use high-performance data structures and data analysis tools and it is popularly used for data science and data analytics.
7.OS -The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system It  provides functions for creating and removing a directory (folder), fetching its contents, changing and identifying the current directory, etc.We used it in our CHATBOT.
8.Webbrowser-The Webbrowser module provides a high-level interface to allow displaying Web-based documents to users.In our app it help us to display the desired webpages.   9.Matplotlib-Matplotlib is a cross-platform, data visualization and graphical plotting library for Python and its numerical extension NumPy.It offers a viable open source alternative to MATLAB. Developers can also use matplotlib’s APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to embed plots in GUI applications.
